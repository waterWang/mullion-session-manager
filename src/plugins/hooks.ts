// agents write newline-delimited JSON to this ONE shared Unix socket

// MULLION_HOOK_SOCKET — see pty-manager.ts's Session.bootstrapMaster()) and
// this listener attributes each connection to a session via a handshake
// token (MULLION_HOOK_TOKEN), validated through app.pty.resolveToken().
//
// Every line after a successful handshake is validated against the wire
// protocol (issue #173, see hook-protocol.ts) — a malformed line gets a
// `{"error":...}` reply and the connection stays open (only a failed
// *handshake*, or an oversized/unterminated line, closes the connection
// outright); a valid one is routed into the Phase 1 notification event
// model via PtyManager.emitHookEvent() (issue #176, see pty-manager.ts's
// Session.emitHookEvent for the per-kind mapping).
//
// No impact on an agent that never connects: the socket exists (like the
// dtach sockets already do) but sits idle otherwise.

// Max bytes buffered per-connection before a line terminator (\n) arrives —
// guards against a single misbehaving or malicious connection growing this
// process's memory unbounded while waiting for a newline that never comes.

// decision (POST /api/sessions/:id/review-gate, routed here via

//
// One gate at a time per session, by design: Claude Code (and any future
