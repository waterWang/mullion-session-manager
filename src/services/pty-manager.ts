// Bridges browser terminals to real, host-persistent processes.
//
// Each Session owns exactly one node-pty child: a `dtach` attach-client. That
// client is dtach's *only* attaching process — dtach itself never sees more
// than one, which is what keeps it chrome-free and resize-clean (see the
// plan's persistence discussion). Any number of browser WebSocket connections
// may subscribe to that single child's data stream and write to it; the
// fan-out/fan-in across tabs happens here in the manager, not in dtach.
//
// The child is spawned once and kept alive for as long as this Node process
// runs, independent of how many browser tabs are attached — closing the last
// tab does NOT kill it. That means the common case (browser tab closes,
// reopens later, Node process never restarted) never needs a fresh dtach-level
// reattach at all: the scrollback ring buffer below is a continuous,
// gap-free record of everything the session produced while unwatched, so
// replaying it reconstructs the screen exactly. A fresh OS-level `dtach -a`
// attach (and the redraw-reliability question in Risk 1 of the plan) is only
// needed when this Node process itself restarts and the child is gone.
//
// The underlying dtach *master* (which actually owns the program) is a
// separate, untracked, fire-and-forget process bootstrapped once via `dtach
// -n` — see Session.spawn() for why conflating master and attach-client was
// Milestone 1's first real finding.

// in that state would never surface attention at all, silently worse than

   * The attention state machine's time-based half (issue #171/#98) — called
   * periodically by PtyManager's own evaluator interval (see
   * ATTENTION_EVAL_INTERVAL_MS), never from onData. Two independent checks:
   *
   * 1. Promote a still-PENDING_ATTENTION signal to ATTENTION once it's gone
   *    uncontradicted long enough (advanceAttention's "tick" input) — the
   *    ONLY way a nonzero-threshold signal (bell/notification) ever
   *    confirms when the program stays genuinely silent afterward; nothing
   *    byte-driven would ever re-check it.
   * 2. The #98 "sustained silence after work" signal: a session that had a
   *    real, sustained activity streak (same `sustained` computation
   *    toInfo() uses) and has since gone quiet for at least SUSTAINED_SILENCE_MS
   *    (or HOOK_FALLBACK_SILENCE_MS — see below) raises a zero-threshold
   *    "silence" candidate. Gated to `attentionState.state === "idle"` — if a
   *    signal is already pending or confirmed, that already covers
   *    "something's up", and (2) running AFTER (1) in the same tick() call
   *    means this reads already-updated state rather than racing it.
   *    The required silence duration depends on `this.hooksActive`: a
   *    session whose command matched a real hook adapter (Claude Code/
   *    opencode/codex/agy) normally gets its "turn is over" signal
   *    authoritatively from that agent's own Stop/session.idle hook (routed
   *    to the `agentIdle` signal by emitHookEvent's "progress"/"done" case)
   *    — the byte guess here can't tell a real "went quiet after work" apart
   *    from the SAME agent's own multi-chunk startup splash render on a
   *    brand-new, never-touched terminal, which is indistinguishable in
   *    bytes alone at SUSTAINED_SILENCE_MS's short timescale. So a
   *    `hooksActive` session raises this signal only after the much longer
   *    HOOK_FALLBACK_SILENCE_MS — a bound no legitimate startup render comes
   *    close to — as a safety net for a hook pipeline that died or wedged
   *    (killed agent process, crashed forwarder, socket that never
   *    connected) rather than genuinely finishing quietly. Hookless sessions
   *    (plain shells, unrecognized commands) have no authoritative signal at
   *    all, so they always use the short SUSTAINED_SILENCE_MS bound. Follow-up
   *    to #275 (gap #1): the long bound additionally requires `hooksProven`,
   *    not `hooksActive` alone — a MATCHED-but-never-PROVEN session (the
   *    untrusted-codex case: `hooksActive` true, but no hook has ever
   *    actually fired because the user hasn't granted codex's own one-time
   *    `/hooks` trust yet — see `hooksProven`'s field doc) uses the fast
   *    SUSTAINED_SILENCE_MS bound too, exactly like a hookless session,
   *    rather than being silently stuck waiting on a signal that will never
   *    come. Only a pipeline that has DEMONSTRABLY delivered at least one
   *    message earns the slow watchdog.
   *
   * `now` is a parameter (defaulting to Date.now()) rather than read
   * unconditionally inside, purely so tests can call this directly with a
   * synthetic clock instead of needing fake real timers — see
   * test/services/pty-manager.test.ts.
